CORE SYSTEM COMPONENTS

Intelligent Demand Prediction Engine:
The system features an advanced demand prediction algorithm that analyzes historical sales data to forecast daily requirements. The algorithm considers multiple factors including seven-day rolling averages, time-of-day multipliers, day-of-week patterns, and applies a safety buffer to ensure availability while minimizing waste. This results in significant reduction in food waste and improved inventory management.

Comprehensive Payment Management:
The payment system supports both digital wallet transactions and cash payments with complete tracking capabilities. Digital wallet payments are processed instantly with automatic balance deduction and transaction logging. Cash payments are recorded manually by staff with pending status tracking until confirmation. The system generates detailed financial reports and provides real-time payment analytics.

Advanced Order Management Workflow:
Orders follow a structured lifecycle from placement to completion with status updates at each stage. The system calculates estimated preparation times based on item complexity and current queue status. Both students and staff receive real-time notifications about order status changes, ensuring transparency and efficient service delivery.

SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION

The system implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user data and ensure secure access:

Multi-Level Authentication:
- Role-based access control separating student and administrator privileges
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Session management with configurable timeout periods
- Admin security codes for elevated access protection

Data Protection:
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection with output encoding
- Secure session cookies with HTTP-only flags
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

Access Control:
- Differentiated session timeouts (30 minutes for admins, 8 hours for students)
- Automatic session extension with user activity
- Secure logout with complete session cleanup
- Access logging for security auditing
